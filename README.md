# car-detection-classification-license_plate-detection

As the name suggests this project is a deep learning project containing four deep learning models :

- Car detection.
- Car classification.
- License plate detection.
- Number plate recognition.
- All integrated into one GUI (Graphic User Interface) application (made in qt designer).

Bellow you will find how to run this app:

1. Run main.py you should get this prompt :

2. Press the load image button.
3. Once loaded it should give the car int the photo as a result along with the number plate (if found).
